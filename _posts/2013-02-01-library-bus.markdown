Building upon the research for the new library bus for Espoo, five concepts were proposed to revolutionise the service. These concepts aimed to demonstrate how the technology in the bus could be used to facilitate various kinds of workshops and events. Some of the more immersive ideas proposed were the Starry Skies, Gardening, Craft-workshop, Movie-nights, Storytelling and a concept for the regular bus.
