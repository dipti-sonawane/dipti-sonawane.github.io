  Iâ€™m a designer with a passion for user interface and experience design. I design products that are simple and engaging. My recent work includes designing interfaces and specifications for complex digital products including custom hardware, displays and watches; across platforms and form factors. My work also spans digital design, new media, graphics, illustration and typography.

  Presently, I am employed at Cresense (now part of Ixonos) as an on-site UI/UX consultant for KONE and Suunto. I have worked for clients such as ABB, Helsinki University, Symbio, Suomi.fi, Forenom, Aalto University, Innofactor and Palkeet. I have 7 years of experience in visual and interaction design.
