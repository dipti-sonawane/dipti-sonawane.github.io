  Iâ€™m a communication designer with a passion for Interaction Design and 
  User Experience Design. Process and user centric design solutions 
  fascinate me. My work involves a range of communication media ranging 
  from new media, graphic and illustration, to type and colour. New Media 
  is a new-found love, primarily driven by my interest in Interaction Design.
